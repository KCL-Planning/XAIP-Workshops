      <p>Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) concerns the challenge of shedding light on opaque models where transparency is important, e.g. in analysis or synthesis tasks. In particular, as AI is increasingly being adopted for deployed applications, the challenge of supporting interaction with humans is becoming more apparent. Partly this is to support collaborations with humans but also it is a necessary step in the process of building trust as humans migrate greater competence and responsibility to AI systems. The challenge is to find effective ways to characterize and communicate the foundations of AI-driven behavior when the algorithms that drive it are far from transparent to humans. While XAI at large is primarily concerned with learning-based approaches, model-based <strong>Explainable AI Planning (XAIP)</strong> can play an important role in addressing complex decision-making procedures.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Mission:</b><br><font size="-1"> As AI is increasingly being adopted into application solutions, the challenge of supporting interaction with humans is becoming more apparent. Partly this is to support integrated working styles, in which humans and intelligent systems cooperate in problem-solving, but it is also a necessary step in the process of building trust as humans invest greater authority and responsibility in intelligent systems. Explainability poses challenges for many types of AI systems, including planning and scheduling (PS) systems. For example, how should a PS system justify that a plan or schedule is correct, or good, or respects supplied preferences? How can the PS system explain particular steps, ordering decisions, or resource choices? How can a PS system explain that no solution is possible, or what relaxations of the constraints would allow a solution? How can a PS system respond to questions like “what is the hard part?” or “why is this taking so long?”. These are all difficult questions that can require analysis of plan or schedule structure, analysis of the goals, constraints, and preferences, and potentially hypothetical reasoning.</font></li>
